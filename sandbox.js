    "Got it. Here is the summary with chapters and bullet points:
    \n\nChapter 1: Introduction\n- Discusses the topic of properly cleaning up network requests made using the `useEffect` hook in React\n- Explains that if these requests are not properly cleaned up, they can continue to run in the background even after the component that made the request has been unmounted, leading to unexpected behavior and potential errors in the application
    \n\nChapter 2: Example\n- Provides an example of a tab component that makes a network request to a \"to-do's\" endpoint\n- Demonstrates how the request can persist in the background if it is not properly cleaned up
    \n\nChapter 3: Solution\n- Suggests a solution to this issue, which involves returning a cleanup function in the `useEffect` hook that aborts the original connection
    \n\nChapter 4: Error Handling\n- Covers error handling, and explains how to display an error message to the user if the API request fails"
